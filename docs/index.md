# Statworx Theme

A color theme plugin for the [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) library and all its derivatives, which automatically applies the official statworx color theme.
This package also registers commonly used [color maps](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html) for use in presentations.
